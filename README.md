   cd banking-system

   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:

```bash
npm install --force
```

3. **Set up environment variables**: Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add the necessary environment variables:

```env
DATABASE_URL=your-postgresql-database-url
```

---

### Running Locally

1. **Development server**: Start the Next.js development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

2. **Access the application**: Open your browser and visit: http://localhost:3000

### Using Docker

1. **Build the Docker image**:

```bash
docker build -t banking-system .
```

2. **Run the Docker container**:

```bash
docker run -p 3000:3000 banking-system
```

3. **Access the application**: Open your browser and visit: http://localhost:3000

#### ⚠ Running Only the Database Service with Docker Compose

**If you want** to run only the PostgreSQL database using Docker Compose, use the following command:

```bash
docker-compose up postgres
```

This will start only the `postgres` service defined in your docker-compose.yml file. Ensure that your .env file contains the correct `DATABASE_URL` pointing to this database instance.
